# global object in nodejs

 - In Node.js, global is a built-in object that represents the global scopeâ€” it's similar to window in a browser environment.
 - global is not the same as globalThis, though in Node.js they usually refer to the same object:
 
 ```javascript
 console.log(global === globalThis); // true
 ```
